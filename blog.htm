                <li>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</li>
                <li>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</li>
                <li>Location:<br> Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</li>
